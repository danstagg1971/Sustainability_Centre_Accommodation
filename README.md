This program is really just  an exercise in writing a program and utilising different files that are categorised for diffeent aspects of the program.
It will be decided up into sections that will include input, calculations defining methods and processing date and outputing the results not just in a terminal window but also to a readable text document or spreadsheet.
The program is made up of three modules:
1 - input.py
2 - variables.py
3 - cust_database.py
